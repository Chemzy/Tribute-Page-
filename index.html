      <h4>Early Life and Education</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>Nikita Dragun was born in Belgium and attended high school in Virginia. She is of Vietnamese and Mexican descent, and came out as a trans woman when she reached college. In several of Dragun's YouTube videos, she has spoken openly about her transition.

Later, Dragun decided to move to Los Angeles, and got accepted to the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, where she obtained her business degree. </p>

      <h4>Career</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>Dragun joined YouTube in February 2013. As of April 2020, she has over 2.69 million subscribers on YouTube.[4]

In response to comments by L Brands chief marketing officer Ed Razek that trans women should not be included in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show because "the show is a fantasy", Dragun tweeted a video of herself modeling lingerie. In the tweet, Dragun argues that trans women were indeed able to convey fantasy.

In March 2019, she announced a make-up line, Dragun Beauty. Aside from the mainstream market, the cosmetic line is also targeted towards the transgender community. All products are vegan and cruelty-free, this is cited as a reason why Nikita decided to launch her brand independently. In June 2019, Dragun was interviewed about her make-up brand on the LGBT radio network Channel Q, where she credited her journey as a transgender woman building her brand as the inspiration behind Dragun Beauty and its products.

In September 2019, it was announced Nikita would be starring in her own docuseries on Snapchat, "Nikita Unfiltered". The series follows Dragun as she searches for love, "a different path" in her career, and navigates fame as a trans woman. The series premiered on March 21, 2020.</p>
